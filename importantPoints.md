1. `Typescript` -> It is a superset of javascript, that adds static typing to the language, in other words, it helps us to catch error earlier in the development process.

2. `React` -> It is a javascript library.

# Points-

When HTMl is loaded in the browser, the browser takes the html code, and creates a tree like structure called as Document object model. This allows us to use javascript, and change the page content, in response to user actions. This is called vanilla javascript. As our application grows, it becomes hard to manage a complex DOM.
In React we do not have to worry on creating and updating DOM elements, instead we describe the web page in small, reusable components and react takes care of efficiently creating and updating DOM elements. Components help us to write, reusable and better organized code. ex. navbar, etc. We build all the components individually and combine them to build a page. Essentially a react application is a tree of components with App as the root bringing everything together.

3. `Public folder` -> public assets of our websites exists, like images, media files etc.
